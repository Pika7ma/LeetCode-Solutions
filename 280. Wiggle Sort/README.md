# 280. Wiggle Sort

## Description

Given an unsorted array `nums`, reorder it **in-place** such that `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]...`.

For example, given `nums = [3, 5, 2, 1, 6, 4]`, one possible answer is `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.

## Solution

We can just simply swap the incorrect order from the beginning to then end. Actually, it works.
